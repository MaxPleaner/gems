# gems

This is just a tiny script which shows the name and descripton of recently added / updated ruby gems (I forget which).

It uses the gem named `gems` and gets the info by calling `Gems.latest`. It prints out only the name and description to save space.

Copy it to /usr/bin/ and run `chmod +x` on the file.
